            Whether purchasing or picking zucchini fresh from the garden -- choose firm, slender zucchini with a bright green color and free of wrinkled skin and soft spots. For best quality, harvest zucchini when it is young and tender, about 6 to 8 inches long and about 2 inches in diameter.

            As zucchini gets longer and bigger around, it becomes tougher and develops more seeds. These larger zucchini can be used to make zucchini bread or other baked items; scoop out seeds and pulp with the tip of a spoon.
